# CoreEngine Manifesto

## 1. Essence
CoreEngine is not just a graphics engine.  
It is the **meeting point between engineering, theory, and creativity**, shaped by the vision **𝛂 → 𝜱 → 𝝮 → 𝐌 → 𝚿 → 𝝎** from the **Theory of Everything (TCD)**.

## 2. Principles

### Android-first
Native integration with Android, Compose, and Jetpack, with idiomatic Kotlin APIs.

### Fidelity to TCD
Every subsystem aligns with the theoretical flow:
- **𝛂 (Time):** Deterministic loop, stable scheduler.
- **𝜱 (Space):** Cameras, projections, transformations.
- **𝝮 (Dynamics):** Update systems and physics.
- **𝐌 (Manifestation):** Accurate, optimized rendering.
- **𝚿 (Consciousness):** Intelligent and adaptive input.
- **𝝎 (Record):** Logging, metrics, and snapshots.

### Modular and clean architecture
Based on `org.coreengine.*` packages, following Clean Architecture and UDF principles.

### Engine + IDE unification
Development powered by **CoreStudio**, a multiplatform IDE with Scene Viewer, real-time Inspector, and synchronized debugging.

### Incremental iteration
Each release is functional, usable, and validated by the community before moving forward.

### High-performance 2D
Hybrid Canvas/OpenGL pipeline with batching and efficient resource management.

### Professional Open Source
Apache 2.0 license, with clear documentation, practical examples, and an open community.

### Scalability and future compatibility
Prepared for Vulkan, WebGPU, dynamic scripting, and multiplatform export.

## 3. Commitment
CoreEngine is a project **by developers for developers**, free of closed dependencies and guided by:
- Transparency
- Innovation
- Respect for community and the theory that inspires it

---

## 4. Road to 2027
By **June 3rd, 2027**, CoreEngine will deliver:
- A stable **1.0 engine release**
- A professional IDE (**CoreStudio**)
- Full documentation, interactive demos, and an active official website
- An ecosystem ready to evolve without breaking its essence

---

⚡️ This Manifesto defines the **Phase 1 foundation** we are currently building:  
a functional, modular, Android-first 2D engine with a clean loop and hybrid rendering pipeline.
